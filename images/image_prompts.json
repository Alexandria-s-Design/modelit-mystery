Validation means testing our model against real experimental data. If predictions match observations - great! If not, we learn something new and improve the model. It's a cycle: Model → Predict → Test → Validate → Improve. This is how all of science works!\nStyle guidance: vibrant sci-fi laboratory lighting, clear character emotions, approachable composition, no gore or frightening elements, maintain continuity with previous illustrations."
