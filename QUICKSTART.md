## 🎯 Winning Strategy

### Stage 1: Identify Components

**Goal**: Place Receptor, Signal, and Enzyme on the canvas

**Tips**:

- You need exactly 3 components
- Think about cellular signaling: what receives, what transmits, what processes?
- Placement doesn't matter yet, just get the right ones!

### Stage 2: Define Relationships

**Goal**: Connect components to show information flow

**Tips**:

- Click a component to select it (turns yellow)
- Click another component to draw a connection
- Think: Signal → Receptor → Enzyme
- You need at least 2 connections

### Stage 3: Set Initial Conditions

**Goal**: Set starting states (ON/OFF) for each component

**Tips**:

- Click components to toggle between ON (green) and OFF (red)
- What starts the cascade? The Signal!
- Signal should be ON, others OFF
